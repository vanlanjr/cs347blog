          This week in web development, we switched gears from learning about basic html and javascript
          development, to working with React and Express Web Services.  React allows us creat dynamic
          applications on the web. It acts as a bridge for concurrency to update the model.  It is quite
          different from what we've been doing before, with less html files, added components, and we have
          a lot less control over the webpage.  There are some similarities though, with CSS files, HTML syntax,
          and event handling in Javascript. In addition to React, we learned about Express. Express allows us
          to communicate with web services via calls to the REST web service.  This framework is going to prove
          to be very useful when development for project 2 starts.
        </p><p>
          Outside of class, I decided to do more research on React since it is so prominant in the web 
          development industry today. At the end of the Fall semester last year when I was applying for 
          a lot of summer internship, almost all of the job descriptions included something about React
          and how prior knowledge of the tool will be very useful.  It was even something that a lot 
          of companies were looking for when they were hiring.
        </p><p>
          Since I am a beginner with React, I decided to focus my extra research on something that
          would help me grasp a basic understanding of it so that I can focus on more of the advanced topics
          later on in the semester. The article I found is called <a href="https://camjackson.net/post/9-things-every-reactjs-beginner-should-know" 
          target="_blank">9 Things That Every React.js Beginner Should Know</a>.  Some of the things I learned
          is that React components should stay small so that they are easier to test and understand. Additionally,
          each component should have a percise function.  In React, there are multiple differnt ways to define
          a component, one being
          <pre>
            const MyComponent = React.createClass({
              render: function() {
                return div className={this.props.className}/>;
              }
            });
          </pre>
          or 
          <pre>
            class MyComponent extends React.Component {
              render() {
                return div className={this.props.className}/>;
              }
            }
          </pre>
          but there is an even better syntax that helps make the code look more consise and well defined.
          This looks like:
          <pre>
            const MyComponent = props => (
              div className={props.className}/>
            );
         </pre>
          In the article, I also learned is to always use propTypes. This is because propTypes add a lot 
          of safety to components by it can allow the developer to catch bugs early by throwing errors
          on silly mistakes. They also add extra documentation to the code which saves other readers from 
          having to search through code looking for the different propTypes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, it is recommended to use JSX, ES6, Babel, Webpack, and NPM. In class, I've already had
          exposure to JSX and NPM. Both have proven to be very useful when working on the labs. JSX is very 
          helpful for creating React elements and NPM is great for package management.
