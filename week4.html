              This week in web development, I learned about how to have a responsive web design using 
              media queries. This taught me to create website that has a good viewport for both desktop
              and mobile screens. Once I learned how to do this, I implemented it in my project 1 assignment
              webpage.  For the lab on this day, my group and I experimented with using media queries to 
              keep the display looking elegant while the browser is resized.  This lab was pretty difficult and 
              my group wasn't able to finish it in class. 
            </p><p>
              The next lecture was about using the grid layout for manipulating forms.  These forms can be designed
              on the webpage or they can be taken in as input from the website's user.  Additionally, I learned
              how to create a list of automatic suggestions for text inputs.  This is more advanced and looks nicer
              than just providing a plain input text box.  The last topic that was covered was creating labels that
              stay in the field of input. Using various CSS techniques, these labels can be subject to outline on click
              and have a defined background from the body.
            </p><p>
              Outside of class, I did some research on the Locomotive Scrolling bar provided on GitHub.  In order to do this,
              I watched a video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrM6N-G6U_M" target="_blank">Locomotive Scroll
              Is Awesome - Here's How to Use it</a>. To apply locomotive scroll to my webpage, I had to download the package using
              npm from Node.js.  My implementation includes javascript as well as new html tags.
            </p><p> 
              Here is the code the scrolling bar:
            </p><p>
              <code>
                <blockquote>
                  JavaScript:<br>
                    import LocomotiveScroll from 'locomotive-scroll';<br>
                    <br>
                    const scroll = new LocomotiveScroll({<br>
                        el: document.querySelector('[data-scroll-container]'),<br>
                        smooth: true<br>
                    });<br>
                  <br>
                  CSS:<br>
                    * {<br>
                      box-sizing: border-box;<br>
                    }<br>
                    main {<br>
                      height: 100vh;<br>
                      margin: 0;<br>
                    }<br>
                    section {<br>
                      height: 100vh;<br>
                    }<br>
                </blockquote>
              </code>
