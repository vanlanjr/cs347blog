          This week in class, I learned more about JavaScript and how to use it to support different funcationalities
          in a webpage. It was very interesting to see a slider input be able to listen to events and change different
          attributes about the page. If I had to do something like this one my own, it would be kind of difficult
          because I am still a little rusty with using JavaScript. Later in the week, I learned about manipulating
          objects in JavaScript which was also difficult because the syntax and come features JavaScript offer
          aren't like any other language so it has been hard for me to get used to it.

          Outside of class, I did research on how to use the html grid layout to create a calendar for 
          the month of October. The reason I was interested in this is because I need to add a calendar to my
          project website that will display the events that my client will be hosting this month. I basically
          have one overarching div that holds a day and number div for the days and numbers of the week. In the CSS 
          file, I target these tags and change their styles.
        </p><p>
          The video that I watched as my starting point is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL3ufzQ0QC4" target="_blank">Calendar 
          UI Design With CSS Grid | Pure Html CSS UI Design</a>. This video was helpful because it showed me the base 
          sturcutre for the calendar. Then, I changed the styling to better fit my needs. My implementation for this 
          can be found at <a href="https://project1.jvfunweb.me/events.html" target="_blank">https://project1.jvfunweb.me/events.html</a>.
          This still needs some more editing but it is a decent start.
        </p><p>
          Here is the CSS styling code I used for the calendar grid layout:
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre>
            main {
              margin: 0;
              padding: 0;
              display: flex;
              justify-content: center;
              align-items: center;
              /* height: 100vh; */
              font-family: sans-serif;

              background-color: lightblue;
              background-size: contain;
            }

            .calendar > h3 {
              display: flex;
              justify-content: center;
              background-color: lightgray;
            }

            .calendar {
              width: 600px;
              height: 600px;
              background: #fff;
              box-sizing: border-box;
            }

            .calendar .date {
              padding: 40px;
              display: grid;
              grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(50px, 1fr));
              grid-gap: 20px;
              box-sizing: border-box;
            }

            .number:nth-child(4) {
              box-sizing: border-box;
              border: solid black 2px;
            }

            .calendar .date div {
              display: flex;
              justify-content: center;
              align-items: center;
              height: 50px;
            }

            .calendar .date div.day {
              font-weight: 700;
            }

            .calendar .date div.day:first-child,
            .calendar .date div.number:nth-child(7n+1) {
              color: #ff685d;
              font-weight: 700;
            }

            .calendar .date div.number:hover {
              background: #009688;
              color: #fff;
              font-weight: 700;
              cursor: pointer;
            }

            .day .number {
              width: 50px;
              height: 50px;
            }
          </pre>
        </p>
      </main>
