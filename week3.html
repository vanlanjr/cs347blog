          This week in web development, the class continued tuning our slideshow website that we started last week.
          So far, this was definietly the most difficuly in-class lab that we have been assigned. This was mostly because
          of the new positioning attribute that we learned about as well as adding javascript to our webpage for 
          the first time. Everyone in my group had no experience with javascript so we had to google every little detailed
          to try and figure out the best solution. 
        </p><p>
          After we finished that lab, we learned about absolute postioning which allows us to anchor boxes against other boxes
          on the page.  Using absolute positioning, we are able to use drop-down menus in our navigation links, which is something
          I look forward to experimenting with in project 1.  At the end of this week, we were also introduced to more javascript,
          and I look forward to learning more about it in the near future.
        </p><p>
          Outside of class, I experimented with changing the page's cursor.  I added a nyan cat as the background image.  I like to 
          think of it as an evil nyan cat because it  won't let you click on other links if it catches up to the pointer so you'll get trapped
          on the page if you're not quick enough.  Have fun!  The video that I watched on Youtube that helped me with this can be found here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfpRZ2t_BrQ&t=411s" target="_blank"> 
          Creating Custom Cursors - CSS Only, and Javascript!</a>
        </p><p>
          Here is the code for evil nyan cat (only works in Chrome for some reason):
        </p><p>
          <code>
            <blockquote>
              .cursor { <br>
                width: 40px;<br>
                height: 40px;<br>
                position: absolute;<br>
                background-image: url('bigger_cat.gif');<br>
                transition-duration: 400ms;<br>
                transition-timing-function: ease-out;<br>
              }<br>
              <br>
              const cursor = document.querySelector('.cursor');<br>
              document.addEventListener('mousemove', e => {<br>
                cursor.setAttribute("style", "top: " +(e.pageY - 20)+"px; left: "+(e.pageX - 20)+"px;")<br>
              });
            </blockquote>
