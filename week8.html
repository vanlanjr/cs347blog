          This week in web development, we learned how to connect a mysql database to a webservice. It was pretty
          hard to follow along since I had no idea what he was doing in why, but I'm sure that it will make more
          sense when I have to follow his directions for starting the mysql database for project 2 and connecting
          it to a web service that my partner and I will develop. One thing that did make sense was the sql
          scripts used to create the database and all the tables for it. This is because I am also taking Databases
          right now so those functions looked very familiar. It was interesting watching the videos because I do
          all my sql development on MySQL Workbench rather than a cmd line text editor so that was neat. Later in 
          the week, we learned about Redux and how it can be used to manage an object's state and all the data that
          is involved.
        </p><p>
           Outside of class, I decided to do more research on JSX and how it is different from JavaScript.  JSX is used
           in React apps as a way to create React elements. The article I read is called <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#why-jsx" 
          target="_blank">JSX In Depth</a>. I learned a hand full of new information and best practices when it comes to
          using JSX in React apps to crete elements.
        </p><p>
          Here are a few of those things:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The first type of the JSX tag specifies the type of the React element.
              <pre>
                React.createElement(
                  MyButton,
                  {color: 'blue', shadowSize: 2},
                  'Click Me'
                )
              </pre>
              is a MyButton React component because of the capitalized first letter, and
              <pre>
                React.createElement(
                  'div',
                  {className: 'sidebar'}
                )
              </pre>
              is a div.
            </li><li>
              Components created by the user should be capitalized and they should also be capitalized when they
              are referenced in code.
            </li><li>
              JavaScript expressions can be passed as props if they are enclosed in {}.
            </li><li>
              You can use ...props as a "spread" operator in a prop that will pass the whole props object. The function:
              <pre>
                function App() {
                  const props = {firstName: 'Ben', lastName: 'Hector'};
                  return <Greeting {...props} />;
                }
              </pre>
              will return the whole props object.
            </li><li>
              You can access a component's children by calling props.children. The children can be a string literal,
              other components, arrays, or JavaScript expressions. 
            </li><li>
              Booleans, null, and undefined are ignored in React. If you want to use these values to appear in output,
              then you need to convert them to a string first. This would look like:
              <pre>
                div>
                  My JavaScript variable is {String(myVariable)}.
                /div>
              </pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </main>
    </div>
