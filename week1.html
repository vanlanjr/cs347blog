          Welcome to my first blog post!  I will cover everything I've done my web development
          class since day one.  So far, it has been really exciting since this is my first
          time ever getting experience with HTML and CSS.    
        </p><p>
          In the first week, I started learning about the history of html, like Tim Berners-
          Lee, as well as getting introduced to web dev basics.  This encapsulated standard html
          tags, basic css styling (both internal and external).  While I learned these new tools,
          I was also setting up my first Digital Ocean droplet.  This droplet is used to host 
          my blog, yes the one you are reading right now, and in the future will hold a website 
          that I create for an JMU organization that I am a member of (more details to come).
          Once the droplet was set up earlier in the week, I started creating my webpage by adding
          an <code>index.html</code> page.  My biggest struggle of the week was setting up my GitHub 
          repository.  While I was going through the process, I acdientally created two .config files
          in my droplet that were for the same port <code>:8000</code> and this was causing me to get a 
          404 Not Found error on the webpage.  Realzing I had two files, I deleted the first one I made
          which finally solved my problem. 
        </p><p>
          For the second week, I was even more busy.  Not only was my work cut out for me in this class,
          but my other CS classes were pilling on homeworks and programming assignments too.  For web dev,
          we learned about the box model and the monocolumn UI pattern.  As you can tell, I was very inspired 
          by the monocolumn pattern and decided to try and implement into the blog "website".  After that, we
          learned about the all powerful flexbox layout and all the goodies it comes with.  I really appreciate
          all the distribution and text alginment that comes with this layout.  The navigation bar is a cool
          addition too.  I tried to do my own version of it but I still need to work out the spacing kinks 
          and try to move my footer to the bottom of the page.  Every week, I seems like I will have a "Bug of
          the Week".  This week, the footer kept me up till 12:45am on Wednesday which I finally gave up on and 
          still working up the courage to try and solve.  My hope is that I will be introduced to another UI layout
          that will allow me to start from fresh again.
