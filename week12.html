          If I were to design my own version of the course, here is what I'd do.  Assuming 
          the course would be on Tuesdays and Thursday, I'd use all of Tuesday to teach a
          lecture that covers the basics for the topic of that week and I'd provide/walk through
          multiple examples.  If it were to be online, I'd record the lecutre so that students
          can refer back to it later.  On Thursday, I would break the students into groups to work
          on a lab assingment that reinforces the materail covered on Tuesday.  I'd make the labs
          a little less short and complicated then they were this semester but make students turn
          them in before the start of the Tuesday class for a lab grade not based on completion. That way
          they are more commited to learning the subjects ensuring they get a good grade.  I'd assign a
          project every three weeks so students have three weeks to do them.  There would also be two short
          exams for the semester that are not worth that many points because I'd like for the class to be
          lab heavy.
        </p><p>
           In terms of what the students would be doing and the material that is covered, I would teach similar
           subjects to what was covered this semester (i.e. htmt, javascript, and react best practices).  Maybe,
           I would look at the leading technologies in the industry and make sure they are talked about/covered 
           in the course so that students have a basic understanding to what is going on in the real world.
        </p><p>
          The biggest thing that helped me learn the course material was the labs completed in class everyday.
          I liked how they mirrored what was talked about for that day's lecture videos.  I also appreciated 
          the lecture videos.  It was nice to be able to look back on them a lot later. With normal lecutres,
          unless they are recorded, there is no going back so having the video lectures in a permanent location was nice.
          In order to help my students learn, I would have a lot of labs like this class. I believe those truly helped
          me learn. Also, I would record my lecutes so that students can refer back to them later.
