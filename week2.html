            This week in class, I expanded my knowledge on the flex box display pattern.  Topics that were covered
            included the lonely child problem and the n-column UI pattern.  I also learned how to implement
            the infamous Holy Grail pattern.  I look forward to applying this pattern in future websites.  I might 
            look into changing the desgin of my blog page but that has yet to come.
        </p><p>
            Outside of class, I did a little bit of extra research myself.  I am intestered in making my blog look better
            so I decided to focus my attention on CSS backgrounds.  This week, the video I watched is 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muE2B0Zylbw" target="_blank">Complex CSS Backgrounds with a Single 
            Property</a>.  After watching the video, I learned about the <code>linear-gradient()</code> property.  With this,
            I was able to make the background have multiple different colors as well change the degree.  There are a lot of 
            design patterns that can be created using the <code>linear- or repeating-gradient() property</code>.  My new background
            on all the pages is a demonstration with what is possible.
